## Prerequisites üìà

Ensure that you install the following libraries in your Python environment or virtual environment:

* Streamlit
* Pandas
* CatBoost
* Xgboost
* Gradient Boost

## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>


To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- Python


### Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Clone this repository to your desired folder:


```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone https://github.com/bamzyyyy/Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
```

Change into the cloned repository

```sh
  cd Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction
  
```

Create a virtual environment

```sh

  python -m venv venv

```

Activate the virtual environment

```sh
  venv/Scripts/activate
```


### Install

Here, you need to recursively install the packages in the `requirements.txt` file using the command below 

```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```


The app will be launched in your default web browser and can then be used to make customer churn predictions based on the input fields.

## Features ‚úÖ

**Sales Prediction**: The app allows users to input your details. It can then predict using the Xgboost, Gradient Boost and CatBoost model from the Machine Learning components.

**Interactive Interface**: Streamlit provides an interactive, easy-to-use, web-based interface.

## Usage Instructions üìã

- Input Fields: The app displays input fields for the Gender, Seniorcitizen, Partner, Dependent, Tenure, Phoneservice, MultipleLines, InternetService, Onlinesecurity, onlinebackup, DeviceProtection, Monthlycharges, Totalcharges, Contracttype, Paperlessbilling, PaymentMethod, TechSupport, DeviceProtection, StreamingTV and StreamingMovies 
- Results: The app will display the predicted Churn rate for the specified inputs.

## Model Training and Saving ‚è≥

The Xgboost, Catboost and Gradient boost model was trained using the Telecommunication Customer Churn as shown in this GitHub repository: [Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-APP
](https://github.com/bamzyyyy/Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-APP/).
